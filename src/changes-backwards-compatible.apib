### Additions

We list all backwards-compatible additions here. These are currently available in all published versions.
(There is also a [list of backwards-incompatible upgrades](#changelog) available, but those only apply if you [upgrade your API version](#upgrading-your-api-version).)

#### Latest
- `tasks.list` and `tasks.info` now returns the milestone_id and deal_id.
- In order to link milestones and deals to a task, we added `milestone_id` and `deal_id` as optional parameters to `tasks.create` and `tasks.update`.
- We added `sent` as a boolean to `invoices.info` and `invoices.list`
- We added an optional filter on `ids` to `invoices.list`.

#### April 2019

- In `users.info`, we added the `status` property to the response since it is now possible to retrieve deactivated users.

- In `users.list`, you can now also request deactivated users, by using a new filter on `status`.
  By default, the endpoint keeps returning active users only. The status is also returned in the response data.

- We've added a `products.add` endpoint.
  Because you can provide the selling price of a product in this endpoint, we also return it in `products.info` from now on.

- We now also return the `payment_reference` of an invoice in the `invoices.list`.
  We also made it filterable through the `payment_reference` filter.

- We added the `purchase_order_number` to all relevant endpoints (`invoices.draft`, `invoices.update`, `invoices.info` and `invoices.list`).
  The property is also filterable through the `purchase_order_number` filter.

- We added `currency_exchange_rate` to `quotations.info`.

- The `events.list` endpoint now has an optional filter property `ids`.

- We added an `invoices.credit` endpoint.

#### March 2019

- On `invoices.draft` and `invoices.update` you can now also provide (a) global discount(s) through the `discounts` property.

- We've published a bunch of `tasks` endpoints (`tasks.list`, `tasks.info`, `tasks.create`, `tasks.update`, `tasks.delete`).

- We now also return a `currency_exchange_rate` on all `.info` endpoints where we support multi-currency.
  That is `quotations.info`, `invoices.info` and `creditNotes.info`.
